## Surface and interactive Visualization Group, Neurohackweek, 8 Sept 2017

We developed a function for surface visualization based on ipyvolume within 
jupyter notebook as well as possibilites to overlay functional files on the surface.
We also worked on an addition to niwidgets in order to make 3D volume and surface 
visualization interactive using niwidgets.

(Mostly) developted by Murat Bilgel, Benjamin Ely, Melanie Ganz, Krisanne Litinas, and Andrea Shafer
Heavily indebted to Satra Ghosh, Chris Holdgraf, Anisha Keshavan, and Tal Yarkoni
Builds on IPyvolume, NiBabel cifti2 package, Michiel Cottaar's cifti tools, and various NHW demo notebooks
